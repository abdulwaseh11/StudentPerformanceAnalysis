Student Performance Analysis Using Power BI ðŸŒŸ
Iâ€™m excited to share my recent project where I analyzed student performance using Power BI! ðŸ“Š
Here are some key insights:
Age Distribution: Most students are between 15-18 years old. 
Gender: Nearly equal distribution with a slight majority of females.
Grade Class: Predominantly grade 'F', highlighting a significant area for improvement.
GPA Statistics:
Average GPA: 1.91
Maximum GPA: 4.00
Standard Deviation: 0.91
Parental Support Impact: Very high parental support correlates with a higher average GPA (2.19).
Extracurricular Activities: Students engaged in extracurricular activities tend to have a higher GPA (2.015).
Absences: More absences are generally associated with lower GPAs.
Parental Education: Parental Education has a slightly ambiguous trend as the Average GPA of students with Parental Education upto College and High School are more than Parental Education upto Bachelors and Masters.
This is due to giving lack of time to their children this should also improve.
Tutoring: Students receiving tutoring have a significantly higher GPA (2.11).
This analysis helps in identifying key factors that influence student performance and provides a basis for interventions to improve educational outcomes.
